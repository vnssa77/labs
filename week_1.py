"""
COMP0088 lab exercises for week 1.

This first introductory set of exercises is largely intended
as a warm up and practice session. It is an opportunity to check
that you have a functioning Python 3 system with the requisite libraries, to get
a feel for some basic data manipulation and plotting, and to ensure that
everything makes sense and runs smoothly.

Add your code as specified below. You shouldn't need to load further external
code that isn't already explicitly imported.

A simple test driver is included in this script. Call it at the command line like this:

  $ python week_1.py

A 4-panel figure, `week_1.pdf`, will be generated so you can check it's doing what you
want. You should not need to edit the driver code, though you can if you wish.
